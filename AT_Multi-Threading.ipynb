    "- Thread-safe code is code that will work even if many Threads are executing it simultaneously. \n",
    "    - It's worth being aware that this sometimes comes at a cost, of computer time and more complex coding, so it isn't always desirable. If a class can be safely used on only one thread, it may be better to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For example, Java has two classes that are almost equivalent, <b>StringBuffer</b> and <b>StringBuilder</b>. The difference is that StringBuffer is thread-safe, so a single instance of a StringBuffer may be used by multiple threads at once. StringBuilder is not thread-safe, and is designed as a higher-performance replacement for those cases (the vast majority) when the String is built by only one thread.\n",
    "- An easier way to understand it, is what make code not thread-safe. There's two main issue that will make a threaded application to have unwanted behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Accessing shared variable without locking This variable could be modified by another thread while executing the function. You want to prevent it with a locking mechanism to be sure of the behavior of your function. General rule of thumb is to keep the lock for the shortest time possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Deadlock caused by mutual dependency on shared variable If you have two shared variable A and B. In one function, you lock A first then later you lock B. In another function, you start locking B and after a while, you lock A. This is a potential deadlock where first function will wait for B to be unlocked when second function will wait for A to be unlocked. This issue will probably not occur in your development environment and only from time to time. To avoid it, all locks must always be in the same order.\n",
